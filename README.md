# Basic scripts
Compilation of new and reused scripts to for host recon, persistence, and exfiltration. Mostly written for PowerShell for deployment by an HID device.

## Quick note
Some of the powershell scripts have ridiculous names. This is to decrease the rate of detection by anti viruses and Windows Defender.

## Another quick note
Make sure you check out the document stealer, it's the best part of this repository.
