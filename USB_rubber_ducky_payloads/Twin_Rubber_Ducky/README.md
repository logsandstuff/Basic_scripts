1) Flash the rubber ducky with Twin rubber ducky firmware.
2) Copy the three files on this folder to the ducky (inject.bin, d.cmd, e.cmd, i.vbs). 
    NOTE: encode your own inject.bin file if you're naming your usb something other than "UO_2020"
3) Put loaded SD card back into the ducky & you're set.
